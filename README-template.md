## Overview

This was a collaborative project between Tom Platt and Joe Walsh. As we both had a passion for space, we decided that we would love to build out a space website. The design was taken from a challenge on Front End Mentor. We wanted to see if we could create a like for like design but with our own spin on the functionality and user experience within.

Overall, we are incredibly happy with how it turned out, it has been challenging but incredibly rewarded and we have learnt so much.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to scroll between the tabs to see new information

  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
